# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed (3) vs done (3)
- Total points committed (26) vs done (26)
- Nr of hours planned (115h 30m) vs spent (111h 20m)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed
- The code was reviewed by at least one other person on the team.
- The code complies with Sonarqube's parameters.

> Please refine your DoD

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  | 28      |        | 67h 30m    | 65h 45m      |

| _#9_  | 11      | 13     | 18h        | 16h          |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)

  - Nr of automated unit test cases:
  - Coverage (if available):
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 4h
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated: 4h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 4h 30m
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning: 3h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 3h 30m

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
